Meeting you here is my pleasure. Since you have viewed my profile, it means you are interested in what I offer. Let me show you some of what I rendered here, I promote brands from scratch into the limelight via strategic planning and implementation of digital marketing strategies.

There are so many ways to get to the market for SMEs,(small and medium-sized enterprises) but I prefer to focus on the 20% tasks that get 80% of the impact on the bottom line.

These are what is needed to implement that:
➡Direct Response Copywriting 
➡Lead Generation
➡ Consistent follow-up with emails and social media.
I achieved these at a scale through high targeted ads on Google, Facebook, Whatsapp, and follow-up email marketing and retargeting ads.

No matter the size or stage of the business, I can create high converting funnels that specifically show where each prospect lies in the customer value journey, giving a predictable path to increase the sales and customer base of the business.

When I am not doing stuff like blogging, copywriting, setting up a funnel, promoting a brand, and email automation, I love to read and of course study my Bible that's a fave!
